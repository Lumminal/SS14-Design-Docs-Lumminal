## What is a Shadowling?

Shadowlings are alien xeno creatures that are sensitive to light. They have taken (likely unknowingly) the form of a crew member, and thus, await their time to awaken and begin their ascension process.

## What type of antagonist are they?

Shadowlings are conversion antags.

## What is unique about a Shadowling?

Shadowlings have quite a lot of unique features.

* Firstly, they **take damage based on lighting** and they are the weakest antag that you can play.

* Secondly, unlike other conversion-based antagonists like Blood Cult and Revs, Shadowlings follow another paradigm. That paradigm being the Master-Follower one.
* Thirdly, they unlock abilities based on their current phase. Before hatch they only own the hatching ability, post hatch they have other new abilities and after Ascension, they unlock upgraded abilities. They do not have a shop.

# Master-Follower

Similarly to head revolutionaries...

The master is the Shadowling, and the follower is the Thrall who the Shadowling has created by enthralling a crew member or even a syndicate member. 

Thralls are to follow their master at all costs, overriding their current loyalty to NanoTrasen, Syndicate or any other corp.
That means, even a Wizard or Nukie can become a Thrall, which (again) means they will help their master ascend instead of following their current objectives.


## A trip back to SS13 Shadowlings and how we can improve them

Shadowlings in SS13 were removed by countless servers and currently, it's hard to find one that has them. But why?

Let's explore some of the reasons;

* They could not enthrall mindshielded crew, making the round unenjoyable by command/sec once they died. This also lead to rounds turning into Rev-Like with cargo ordering countless mindshields.
* They were either snowballing or dying/hiding 
* They were a major antagonist, therefore once all Slings died, the round would technically end there with nothing to do. Not to mention once one Sling gets spotted, everyone will be carrying lights, leaving the other Slings cornered unless they have an advantage (from Thralls).

How can they be fixedâ€¦

* Shadowlings should be able to enthrall mindshielded crew by any means. Either through their current enthrall ability or through a new one.
* A proposed fix for their weaknesses is to let them scale light resistances based on Thralls. Since they can't wear any clothing and armor, this would help massively at early round.
* Make them spawn along major antagonists
* Make them less-murderbone before ascension. They should only get as many thralls, instead of killing.

## Mechanics: Basic Abilities

A rule (I personally believe) we should follow when porting SS13 content to SS14 is to add our own variations instead of blatantly copying them. Therefore...

### Pre-Hatch 
### Hatch
Hatch is the first ability that the Shadowling owns once they spawn, along with access to the Hivemind Channel. Once the player engages hatching, they will be warned and once they decide they want to hatch, the process will begin. 
A container egg entity will spawn in their coordinates and insert them inside, dropping their clothes in the process. Once a few minutes pass, the egg will break and the Shadowling will unlock new abilities and change their skin colour, becoming **valid** to everyone. It is to be noted that the egg can not be broken, and Shadowlings shouldn't be able to take damage in this process by external forces. 
### Post Hatch 

### Enthrall
The most basic ability of the Sling. It is the ability that converts people to their side. 

### Glare
Single target stun ability that can work at any distance. The closer it is activated to the Shadowling, the more effective it will be. For example, if the target is on the end of the screen, then there's gonna be delay and a small amount of stun. If the target is next to the Shadowling, then the stun will take effect immediately and the target will also be muted.

### Veil
Similarly to EMP-related actions, Veil just turns off the lighting in the area around the Shadowling

### Shadow walk 
The Shadowling gains the ability to become invisible and move faster for some amount of time. They can't phase through walls, but their ability lasts longer.

### Icy Veins
AOE ability that outputs a cold temperature and stuns targets in the area around the Shadowling. Think of the Changeling's cryogenic sting.

### Collective Mind
Gives the Shadowling new abilities based on Thralls. Briefly stuns all Thralls and Lesser Shadowlings. 

### Rapid Re-Hatch
Ability to heal all damage in some amount of time

### Destroy Engines 
Delays the evacuation shuttle by 10 minutes 

### Thrall Based Abilities

Note; The brackets indicate the amount of Thralls required
### Sonic Screech [3]
Damages windows, stuns silicons and deafens people

### Blindness Smoke[5]
Emits a smoke that blinds non-shadowlings and heals thralls/shadowlings

### Null Charge[7]
Disables an APC until it is fixed

### Black Recuperation[9]
Either brings back a dead Thrall to life, or promotes a Thrall to Lesser Shadowling

### Empowered Enthrall (SS14 Unique)[7]
Gives the Shadowling the ability to Enthrall mindshielded individuals

### I Am Light (SS14 Unique)[12]
Forms an dark angelic crown around the Shadowling and makes it immune from all Lighting Damage. Lasts for all round.

### Ascension [20]
Ascends. Destroys all lights in the station, stuns everyone for some seconds and gains new abilities. 
They become *nearly* unkillable and their basic attacks do the same damage as an esword. They can still be killed though... 

### Ascension Abilities

### Annihilate
Insta-gib

### Hypnosis
Insta-thrall (anyone)

### Plane-Shift
Shadow Walk but you can phase through walls and it's a Toogle action

### Lighting Storm
Shocks everyone around them

### Ascendant Broadcast
Sends an announcement to all players


## Mechanics: Passive Abilities

### Hivemind
Shadowlings can talk in their Hivemind with the :8 prefix

### Light Resistance 
Based on the amount of Thralls, they gain some form light resistance. This makes Security and Crew to not spam lights, and fight them head-on. If I Am Light is used, this passive gets disabled and the ability takes over.

Scalings:
0-3: 10% Light Resistance 
4-7: 25% Light Resistance 
8-12: 50% Light Resistance

## Why should they be added to the game?

They should be added because they are a unique conversion antagonist that will not rely on murderboning, but on strategic planning. 

Shadowlings should be a gamemode that is fun to play in (by working towards Ascension and leading your Thralls), and fun to play against (by getting to play as a Thrall)
