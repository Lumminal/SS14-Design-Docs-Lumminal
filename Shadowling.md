## What is a Shadowling?

Shadowlings are alien xeno creatures that are sensitive to light. They have taken (likely unknowingly) the form of a crew member, and thus, await their time to awaken and begin their ascension process.

## What type of antagonist are they?

Shadowlings are conversion and progression based antags.

## What is unique about a Shadowling?

Shadowlings have quite a lot of unique features.

* Firstly, they **take damage based on lighting** and they are the weakest round-start antag.
* Secondly, unlike other conversion-based antagonists like Blood Cult and Revs, Shadowlings follow another paradigm. That paradigm being the Master-Follower one.
* Thirdly, they unlock abilities based on their current phase, which means they are progression based (think Heretic). Before hatch they only own the hatching ability, post hatch they have other new abilities and after Ascension, they unlock upgraded abilities. They, however, do not have a shop.

# Master-Follower

Similarly to head revolutionaries...

The master is the Shadowling, and the follower is the Thrall who the Shadowling has created by enthralling a crew member or even a syndicate member. 

Thralls are to follow their master at all costs, overriding their current loyalty to NanoTrasen, Syndicate or any other corp.
That means, even a Wizard or Nukie can become a Thrall, which (again) means they will help their master ascend instead of following their current objectives.

## A trip back to SS13 Shadowlings and how we can improve them

Shadowlings in SS13 were removed by countless servers and currently, it's hard to find one that has them. But why?

Let's explore some of the reasons;

* They could not enthrall mindshielded crew, making the round unenjoyable by command/sec once they died. This also lead to rounds turning into Rev-Like with cargo ordering countless mindshields.
* They were either snowballing or dying/hiding 
* They were a major antagonist, therefore once all Slings died, the round would technically end there with nothing to do. Not to mention once one Sling gets spotted, everyone will be carrying lights, leaving the other Slings cornered unless they have an advantage (from Thralls).

How can they be fixedâ€¦

* Shadowlings should be able to enthrall mindshielded crew by any means. Either through their current enthrall ability or through a new one.
* A proposed fix for their weaknesses is to let them scale light resistances based on Thralls. Since they can't wear any clothing and armor, this would help massively at early round.
* Make them spawn along major antagonists.
* Make them unable to carry any weapons, so they rely more on Thralls and their abilities.
* Make them less-murderbone before ascension. They should only get as many thralls, instead of killing.

## Mechanics: Basic Abilities

A rule (I personally believe) we should follow when porting SS13 content to SS14 is to add our own variations instead of blatantly copying them. Therefore...

| **Ability**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Hatch**           | Initial stage before the Shadowling can hatch.                                                                                                               |
| **Hatch**               | The Shadowling hatches from an egg, gaining new abilities and a change in skin color. The process is protected from external damage.                          |
| **Post Hatch**          |                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Rapid Re-Hatch**      | Heals all damage over a short period.                                                                                                                         |

| **Nox Imperii [12]**    | Forms a dark angelic crown around the Shadowling, making them immune to all lightning damage for the round.                                                   |
| **Ascension [20]**      | Ascends the Shadowling, destroying all lights in the station, stunning everyone for a short duration, and gaining new abilities. Becomes nearly unkillable.  |

## Mechanics: Passive Abilities

### Shadowmind
Shadowlings and Thralls can talk in their own language by opening the language menu, similar to Blood Cultists

### Light Resistance 
Based on the amount of Thralls, they gain some form of light resistance. This makes Security and Crew to not spam lights, and fight them head-on. If I Am Light is used, this passive gets disabled and the ability takes over.

Scalings:
0-3: 10% Light Resistance 
4-7: 25% Light Resistance 
8-12: 50% Light Resistance

## Psionic Interaction

### Enthrall
Can not interact with psionic insulated people

## Ascension

Ascension acts similar to the nuke or summoning nar'sie. The Shadowling will form a cocoon and step inside it, activating a timer. In this moment, the Shadowling can not do anything other than put it's faith into the Thralls to protect it. 
In order to stop the ascension, the crew needs to destroy the cocoon by smashing and shooting it before it hatches.

## Shadow Damage (not considered yet)

Shadowlings gain a new damage type called Shadow Damage that they deal in very small amounts from their punches.

Shadow Damage can only be healed through a special reagent that can be found in the Shadowling's hatching egg

Shadow Damage will be included in a few abilities

## Weaknesses 

Shadowlings are technically 3-4 gunshots from dying since they don't have any armor. If you can bypass it's Thralls and kill it quick, you've easily won.

Shadowlings can not carry weapons and clothes, so they only rely on Thralls communication and their abilities.


## Why should they be added to the game?

They should be added because they are a unique conversion antagonists that will not rely on murderboning, but on strategic planning. 

Shadowlings should be a gamemode that is fun to play in (by working towards Ascension and leading your Thralls), and fun to play against (by getting to play as a Thrall)
